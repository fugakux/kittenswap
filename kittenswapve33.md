Kittenswap: ve(3,3) — How It Works (Full Guide)

This is a complete, consumer-friendly yet accurate guide to ve(3,3) on Kittenswap—a DEX with weekly epochs, a vote-escrowed NFT called VeKitten, and a decreasing emission of the $KITTEN token. Kittenswap uses one-week epochs; the reward token is $KITTEN (18 decimals); the initial weekly emission is 19.8M $KITTEN per epoch; emissions decay by 1% per epoch (compounded); and the weekly emission for epoch n follows Eₙ = 19.8M × 0.99^(n−1).

TL;DR: Lock $KITTEN to receive a VeKitten, which gives you voting power that increases with how much and how long you lock, then decays toward your lock’s expiry. Each week, Kittenswap mints that week’s $KITTEN according to a schedule that starts at 19.8M and drops by 1% every week. VeKitten holders vote on which liquidity pools receive that week’s emissions, and LPs who have staked LP tokens in a pool’s Gauge earn the emissions routed to that pool. Voters can earn bribes (bonus tokens posted by anyone to attract votes) and a share of trading fees from the pools they supported, and there may be a small rebase to VeKitten holders to offset dilution. The 1% decay helps inflation glide down over time and encourages early participation.

Weekly rhythm: Kittenswap operates on a one-week epoch. When an epoch flips, your current votes are snapshotted and those votes determine how the upcoming week’s emissions are routed. The protocol mints the week’s emission Eₙ, then splits that amount across pools in proportion to vote weight. During the week, each pool’s Gauge streams rewards to staked LPs, while voters for those pools can claim the bribes and fee-shares tied to their votes. Your votes typically persist until you change them, and you can re-vote before the next snapshot to pursue better opportunities.

Emissions schedule: In week 1, Kittenswap emits E₁ = 19.8M $KITTEN. Every subsequent week, the emission is multiplied by 0.99 (a 1% reduction), so week n is Eₙ = 19.8M × (0.99)^(n−1). The cumulative amount minted after N weeks is S_N = 19.8M × (1 − 0.99^N) / (1 − 0.99) = 1.98B × (1 − 0.99^N), and in the very long run the total approaches S_∞ = 1.98B $KITTEN. For intuition, the first twelve weeks are roughly 19.80M, 19.60M, 19.41M, 19.21M, 19.02M, 18.83M, 18.64M, 18.45M, 18.27M, 18.09M, 17.91M, 17.73M $KITTEN; the app follows the exact geometric schedule.

VeKitten (locking, voting power, decay): When you lock $KITTEN, you mint a VeKitten. Your voting power increases with both the amount you lock and the time you choose to lock, commonly with a simple time-weighting up to a maximum lock (for example, two years). That voting power decays to zero as your lock approaches expiry. You can extend your lock or add more tokens to refresh or increase voting power. Because VeKitten is an NFT, you can transfer, merge, or split positions as supported. With a VeKitten, you vote on pools each week and can earn voter rewards such as bribes and fee-shares (and a rebase if enabled).

Voting and gauges: Every liquidity pool on Kittenswap has a corresponding Gauge. VeKitten holders allocate their voting power across gauges, for example, 70% to KITTEN/HYPE and 30% to FeUSD/USDT. At the weekly snapshot, Kittenswap totals all votes and routes that week’s emissions pro-rata to the gauges according to their vote weights. LPs must stake their LP tokens in the Gauge to receive the streamed $KITTEN for that epoch.

Bribes and fees for voters: Bribes are extra tokens that anyone can post to a pool’s Bribe contract to attract votes; if you voted for that pool during the week, you can claim your share. In addition, a portion of each pool’s trading fees is shared with that week’s voters of that pool. Together, bribes and fee-shares mean that voting wisely—typically on pools with healthy trading activity or attractive bribes—can be profitable for lockers.

LP rewards: LPs earn the $KITTEN emissions that voters route to their pool. To participate, you add liquidity, receive LP tokens, and then stake those LP tokens in the pool’s Gauge. Rewards are streamed throughout the week and can be claimed in the app. Since emissions are vote-driven, pools with more votes will stream more $KITTEN to their staked LPs.

Rebase / anti-dilution: Kittenswap can optionally allocate a small slice of each week’s emissions to VeKitten holders as a rebase, typically distributed pro-rata to current voting power at snapshot time. This adjustment helps offset dilution for lockers and rewards long-term alignment. If a rebase is enabled, it will be shown clearly in the app and documentation.
